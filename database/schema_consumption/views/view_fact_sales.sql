DDL Script: Create Consumption Views
===============================================================================
Script Purpose:
    This script creates views for the Consumption layer in the data warehouse. 
    The Consumption layer represents the final dimension and fact tables (Star Schema).

    Each view performs transformations and combines data from the Curated layer 
    to produce a clean, enriched, and business-ready dataset.

Usage:
    - These views can be queried directly for analytics and reporting.
